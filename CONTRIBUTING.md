# Purpose
Congratulations on wanting to contribute to the project! Whether this be the first project you've contributed to or the nth, I'm happy that you've chosen to do so.
This file serves as a guide on the contribution standards for the project, such that your pull requests will be more likely to be merged.

# General Guidelines
- When making additions, ensure they are general and widely employable, not niche or otherwise particularly specific.
- Please follow the format of other modules if you are attempting to introduce a new one, unnecessary deviation will result in a rejected merge.
- While commenting is far from mandatory, it is appreciated.
- Keep it professional throughout.
- If proposing a deletion or alteration, please explain why as a comment along with your pull request.

# I Have an Issue
If you have an issue but do not want to contribute to the project, that is fine. Please open an issue on the page and I'll be sure to review it. But if you do choose
to contribute, I'm excited to see what comes from it.

# Summary and Additional Information
Please feel free to open pull requests if you wish, or fork the project for personal use. If you do decide that you want to contribute to the main project, please
follow the guidelines delineated above. If you have any remarks irreconciliable with the above standards, unfortunately, there is currently no other way to reach out
to me. However, I will be establishing means of contact eventually and will update this with those points at a later date such that people may contact me individually.
Thank you for your interest, and happy hunting!
