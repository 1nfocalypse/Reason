# What is it?
Reason is a modular pre-exploitation framework with the intent of allowing customizable intelligence reports utilizing a myriad of tools.
While the details are still being flushed out, it is hoped that Reason will be able to enumerate, scan, report, and advise on targets in an automated,
simplified, and customizable package. Reason is intended to consolidate many of the pre-exploitation and intelligence gathering steps such that there
is more time for thinking, and less time spent searching and waiting.
